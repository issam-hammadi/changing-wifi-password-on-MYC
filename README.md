# changing-wifi-password-on-MYC
I ve been changing the wifi password for long time and it's so boring so I ve decided to create a programm that do that for me using pyautogui module in python. if you want to use it the only thing you need to doo if you are on windows  10 is change the coordinates of the settings you have.
i ve created a batch file which runs the programm so it became runnable from the windows => run.
